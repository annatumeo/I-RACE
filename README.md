# I-RACE
Welcome to **I**-**RACE**: utilising **I**ntegrated constructed wetlands to **R**educe **A**ntimicrobial resistance and increase **C**arbon sequestration in the **E**nvironment.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing societal issues of our time. The Integrated Constructed Wetland (ICW) concept (1) has been applied in the treatment of a diverse range of effluents from agricultural and food processing industries in Ireland over the past 20 years. Previous research by this group and others has demonstrated the potential of ICWs to reduce the levels of antimicrobial resistant organisms (AROs) released into the environment by treated water. Furthermore, appropriately constructed and maintained ICWs may have an application to sequester carbon.

I-RACE undertakes a detailed investigation of the mechanisms of action of ICWs serving different sectors in removing AROs from wastewaters, as well as their ability to act as carbon sinks. The project is interdisciplinary, involving experienced researchers in microbiology, bioinformatics and veterinary public health working with hydrology and engineering experts in the construction and operation of ICWs (2).
