# I-RACE
Welcome to **I**-**RACE**: utilising **I**ntegrated constructed wetlands to **R**educe **A**ntimicrobial resistance and increase **C**arbon sequestration in the **E**nvironment.

A first shotgun metagenomic investigation of Irish ICWs that aims to advance our knowledge on microbial community dynamics in wastewater treatment. Through the reconstruction of influent and effluent bacterial populations and their changes upon treatment, I-RACE aims to provide insights into the efficacy of these nature-based wastewater treatment systems at mitigating AMR and pathogenic taxa.
